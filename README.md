Project on Accelerated Futures: Storytelling in VR to elicit Empathy

Motivation and Explanation :-

The motivation behind the project is to show the user the impact of diet and exercise on a person’s health, specifically on someone’s body mass index (BMI). The goal of our project is to encourage users to make healthy diet and exercise choices regularly so that they can maintain a healthy BMI.

In this project, we offer the users two decision choices: one based on food and the other based on exercise. The dietary choice involves deciding whether to eat at home or to go out to eat at a fast food restaurant. The exercise choice asks the user to choose between going to the mall with a friend or helping a friend carry groceries home from the grocery store.



Empathy :-

The empathy of our virtual experience arises from the use of an avatar for the user. At the beginning, users can choose between a male and female avatar. Users can then see the effects their choices had on this avatar’s BMI in the doctor’s office scene.
